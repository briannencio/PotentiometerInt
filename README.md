# PotentiometerInt
Modify LED intensity by using a potentiometer. It is a manual recreation of a street ligth. At daytime the LED will turn off, from the center to the right, and on night time it will be on, from the center to the right. Keep in mind the the darker it gets the more intense the light will be.
